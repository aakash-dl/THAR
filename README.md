The dataset consists 11,549 YouTube comments in Hindi-English code-mixed language for targeted hate speech detection against religion. Binary and multi-class tagging of YouTube comments is used. The classification of YouTube comments addresses two subtasks:
Subtask-1 (Binary classification): comments are labeled as antireligion or non-antireligion.
Subtask-2 (Multi-class classification): comments are labeled on the major targeted religions such as Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity, with a ‘none’ class also provided.
